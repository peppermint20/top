    <p>
      Bánh Xèo is a Vietnamese dish that is made using rice flour. I like this
      dish because it is very flavorful and savory. Usually you there is a light
      fish sauce that is used that helps cut the oily taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Batter</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup rice flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
      <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>¾ pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound mung bean sprouts</li>
      <li>4 lettuce leaves, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the crêpe batter: Mix rice flour, sugar, salt, and turmeric
        together in a large bowl. Beat in coconut milk until thick. Slowly beat
        in water until it reaches the consistency of a thin crêpe batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant
        but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add shrimp; sauté until cooked through
        and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with fish sauce and salt. Transfer
        filling to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Wipe out the skillet and reheat over medium heat. Add remaining 1/2
        tablespoon oil. Stir crêpe batter and pour 1/2 cup into the hot skillet,
        swirling to coat the bottom. Lay 3 or 4 cooked shrimp on the bottom half
        of the crêpe. Top with a small handful of bean sprouts. Cook until
        batter looks set and edges start to brown, about 1 minute. Fold crêpe
        over and slide onto an oven-safe plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place crêpe in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining
        batter, shrimp, and bean sprouts
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve crêpes with lettuce leaves. Break off pieces of crêpe and roll
        them up in lettuce to eat.
      </li>
    </ol>
